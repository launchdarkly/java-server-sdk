# Change log


All notable changes to the LaunchDarkly Java SDK will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

## [3.0.0]
## Added
- Add support for user segments

## Changed
- Changed FeatureStore interface to support segments

## [2.5.0] - 2018-01-08
## Added
- Support for specifying [private user attributes](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/private-user-attributes) in order to prevent user attributes from being sent in analytics events back to LaunchDarkly. See the `allAttributesPrivate` and `privateAttributeNames` methods on `LDConfig.Builder` as well as the `privateX` methods on `LDUser.Builder`.

## [2.4.0] - 2017-12-20
## Changed
- Added an option to disable sending analytics events
- No longer attempt to reconnect if a 401 response is received (this would indicate an invalid SDK key, so retrying won't help)
- Simplified logic to detect dropped stream connections
- Increased default polling interval to 30s
- Use flag data in redis before stream connection is established, if possible (See #107)
- Avoid creating HTTP cache when streaming mode is enabled (as it won't be useful). This makes it possible to use the SDK in Google App Engine and other environments with no mutable disk access.


## [2.3.4] - 2017-10-25
## Changed
- Removed GSON dependency from default jar (fixes #103)

## [2.3.2] - 2017-09-22
## Changed
- Only log a warning on the first event that overflows the event buffer [#102]

## [2.3.1] - 2017-08-11
## Changed
- Updated okhttp-eventsource dependency to 1.5.0 to pick up better connection timeout handling.

## [2.3.0] - 2017-07-10
## Added
- LDUser `Builder` constructor which accepts a previously built user as an initialization parameter.


## [2.2.6] - 2017-06-16
## Added
- #96 `LDUser` now has `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods

## Changed
- #93 `LDClient` now releases resources more quickly when shutting down

## [2.2.5] - 2017-06-02
## Changed
- Improved Gson compatibility (added no-args constructors for classes we deserialize)
- Automated release process 


## [2.2.4] - 2017-06-02
## Changed
- Improved Gson compatibility (added no-args constructors for classes we deserialize)
- Automated release process 


## [2.2.3] - 2017-05-10
### Fixed
- Fixed issue where stream connection failed to fully establish

## [2.2.2] - 2017-05-05
### Fixed
- In Java 7, connections to LaunchDarkly are now possible using TLSv1.1 and/or TLSv1.2
- The order of SSE stream events is now preserved. ([launchdarkly/okhttp-eventsource#19](https://github.com/launchdarkly/okhttp-eventsource/issues/19))

## [2.2.1] - 2017-04-25
### Fixed
- [#92](https://github.com/launchdarkly/java-client/issues/92) Regex `matches` targeting rules now include the user if
a match is found anywhere in the attribute.  Before fixing this bug, the entire attribute needed to match the pattern.

## [2.2.0] - 2017-04-11
### Added
- Authentication for proxied http requests is now supported (Basic Auth only)

### Changed
- Improved Redis connection pool management.

## [2.1.0] - 2017-03-02
### Added
- LdClientInterface (and its implementation) have a new method: `boolean isFlagKnown(String featureKey)` which checks for a 
feature flag's existence. Thanks @yuv422!

## [2.0.11] - 2017-02-24
### Changed
- EventProcessor now respects the connect and socket timeouts configured with LDConfig.

## [2.0.10] - 2017-02-06
### Changed
- Updated okhttp-eventsource dependency to bring in newer okhttp dependency
- Added more verbose debug level logging when sending events

## [2.0.9] - 2017-01-24
### Changed
- StreamProcessor uses the proxy configuration specified by LDConfig.

## [2.0.8] - 2016-12-22
### Changed
- Better handling of null default values.

## [2.0.7] - 2016-12-21
### Changed
- allFlags() method on client no longer returns null when client is in offline mode.

## [2.0.6] - 2016-11-21
### Changed
- RedisFeatureStore: Update Jedis dependency. Improved thread/memory management.

## [2.0.5] - 2016-11-09
### Changed
- The StreamProcessor now listens for heartbeats from the streaming API, and will automatically reconnect if heartbeats are not received.

## [2.0.4] - 2016-10-12
### Changed
- Updated GSON dependency version to 2.7

## [2.0.3] - 2016-10-10
### Added
- StreamingProcessor now supports increasing retry delays with jitter. Addresses [https://github.com/launchdarkly/java-client/issues/74[(https://github.com/launchdarkly/java-client/issues/74)

## [2.0.2] - 2016-09-13
### Added
- Now publishing artifact with 'all' classifier that includes SLF4J for ColdFusion or other systems that need it.

## [2.0.1] - 2016-08-12
### Removed
- Removed slf4j from default artifact: [#71](https://github.com/launchdarkly/java-client/issues/71)

## [2.0.0] - 2016-08-08
### Added
- Support for multivariate feature flags. New methods `boolVariation`, `jsonVariation` and `intVariation` and `doubleVariation` for multivariates.
- Added `LDClientInterface`, an interface suitable for mocking `LDClient`.

### Changed
- The `Feature` data model has been replaced with `FeatureFlag`. `FeatureFlag` is not generic.
- The `allFlags` method now returns a `Map<String, JsonElement>` to support multivariate flags.

### Deprecated
- The `toggle` call has been deprecated in favor of `boolVariation`.

### Removed
- The `getFlag` call has been removed.
- The `debugStreaming` configuration option has been removed.
