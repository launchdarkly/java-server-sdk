   * The <a href="https://github.com/launchdarkly/java-logging"><code>com.launchdarkly.logging</code></a>
   * API defines the {@link LDLogAdapter} interface to specify where log output should be sent. By default,

   * the {@link com.launchdarkly.logging.Logs} factory methods, or a custom implementation, to handle log
   * output differently. For instance, you may specify {@link com.launchdarkly.logging.Logs#basic()} for
   * simple console output, or {@link com.launchdarkly.logging.Logs#toJavaUtilLogging()} to use the
   * <code>java.util.logging</code> framework.

   * For more about logging adapters,
   * see the <a href="https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/features/logging#java">SDK reference guide</a>
   * and the <a href="https://launchdarkly.github.io/java-logging">API documentation</a> for
   * <code>com.launchdarkly.logging</code>.
   * <p>
   * If you don't need to customize any options other than the adapter, you can call

  /**
   * Specifies a custom base logger name.
   * <p>
   * Logger names are used to give context to the log output, indicating that it is from the
   * LaunchDarkly SDK instead of another component, or indicating a more specific area of
   * functionality within the SDK. Many logging implementations show the logger name in
   * in brackets, for instance:
   * <pre><code>
   *     [com.launchdarkly.sdk.LDClient] INFO: Reconnected to LaunchDarkly stream
   * </code></pre>
   * <p>
   * If you are using an adapter for a third-party logging framework such as SLF4J (see
   * {@link #adapter(LDLogAdapter)}), most frameworks have a mechanism for filtering log
   * output by the logger name.
   * <p>
   * By default, the SDK uses a base logger name of <code>com.launchdarkly.sdk.LDClient</code>.
   * Messages will be logged either under this name, or with a suffix to indicate what
   * general area of functionality is involved:
   * <ul>
   * <li> <code>.DataSource</code>: problems or status messages regarding how the SDK gets
   * feature flag data from LaunchDarkly. </li>
   * <li> <code>.DataStore</code>: problems or status messages regarding how the SDK stores its
   * feature flag data (for instance, if you are using a database). </li> 
   * <li> <code>.Evaluation</code>: problems in evaluating a feature flag or flags, which were
   * caused by invalid flag data or incorrect usage of the SDK rather than for instance a
   * database problem. </li>
   * <li> <code>.Events</code> problems or status messages regarding the SDK's delivery of
   * analytics event data to LaunchDarkly. </li>
   * </ul>
   * <p>
   * Setting {@link #baseLoggerName(String)} to a non-null value overrides the default. The
   * SDK still adds the same suffixes to the name, so for instance if you set it to
   * <code>"LD"</code>, the example message above would show <code>[LD.DataSource]</code>.

   * A data source outage means that an error condition, such as a network interruption or an error from
   * the LaunchDarkly service, is preventing the SDK from receiving feature flag updates. Many outages are
   * brief and the SDK can recover from them quickly; in that case it may be undesirable to log an

   * tools. So, by default, the SDK logs such errors at {@code WARN} level. However, if the amount of time
   * specified by this method elapses before the data source starts working again, the SDK will log an
   * additional message at {@code ERROR} level to indicate that this is a sustained problem.
