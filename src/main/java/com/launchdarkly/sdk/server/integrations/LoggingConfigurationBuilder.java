   * A data source outage means that an error condition, such as a network interruption or an error from
   * the LaunchDarkly service, is preventing the SDK from receiving feature flag updates. Many outages are
   * brief and the SDK can recover from them quickly; in that case it may be undesirable to log an
   * {@code ERROR} line, which might trigger an unwanted automated alert depending on your monitoring
   * tools. So, by default, the SDK logs such errors at {@code WARN} level. However, if the amount of time
   * specified by this method elapses before the data source starts working again, the SDK will log an
   * additional message at {@code ERROR} level to indicate that this is a sustained problem.
   * <p>
   * The default is {@link #DEFAULT_LOG_DATA_SOURCE_OUTAGE_AS_ERROR_AFTER}. Setting it to {@code null}
   * will disable this feature, so you will only get {@code WARN} messages.
