   * Creates a {@link FileDataSourceBuilder} which you can use to configure the file data source.
   * This allows you to use local files (or classpath resources containing file data) as a source of
   * feature flag state, instead of using an actual LaunchDarkly connection.
   * <p>
   * This object can be modified with {@link FileDataSourceBuilder} methods for any desired
   * custom settings, before including it in the SDK configuration with
   * {@link com.launchdarkly.sdk.server.LDConfig.Builder#dataSource(com.launchdarkly.sdk.server.subsystems.DataSourceFactory)}.
   * <p>
   * At a minimum, you will want to call {@link FileDataSourceBuilder#filePaths(String...)} to specify
   * your data file(s); you can also use {@link FileDataSourceBuilder#autoUpdate(boolean)} to
   * specify that flags should be reloaded when a file is modified. See {@link FileDataSourceBuilder}
   * for all configuration options.
   * <pre>
   *     FileDataSourceFactory f = FileData.dataSource()
   *         .filePaths("./testData/flags.json")
   *         .autoUpdate(true);
   *     LDConfig config = new LDConfig.Builder()
   *         .dataSource(f)
   *         .build();
   * </pre>
   * <p>
   * This will cause the client <i>not</i> to connect to LaunchDarkly to get feature flags. The
   * client may still make network connections to send analytics events, unless you have disabled
   * this with {@link com.launchdarkly.sdk.server.Components#noEvents()}. IMPORTANT: Do <i>not</i>
   * set {@link com.launchdarkly.sdk.server.LDConfig.Builder#offline(boolean)} to {@code true}; doing so
   * would not just put the SDK "offline" with regard to LaunchDarkly, but will completely turn off
   * all flag data sources to the SDK <i>including the file data source</i>.
   * <p>
   * Flag data files can be either JSON or YAML. They contain an object with three possible
   * properties:
   * <ul>
   * <li> {@code flags}: Feature flag definitions.
   * <li> {@code flagVersions}: Simplified feature flags that contain only a value.
   * <li> {@code segments}: User segment definitions.
   * </ul>
   * <p>
   * The format of the data in {@code flags} and {@code segments} is defined by the LaunchDarkly application
   * and is subject to change. Rather than trying to construct these objects yourself, it is simpler
   * to request existing flags directly from the LaunchDarkly server in JSON format, and use this
   * output as the starting point for your file. In Linux you would do this:
   * <pre>
   *     curl -H "Authorization: {your sdk key}" https://app.launchdarkly.com/sdk/latest-all
   * </pre>
   * <p>
   * The output will look something like this (but with many more properties):
   * <pre>
   * {
   *     "flags": {
   *         "flag-key-1": {
   *             "key": "flag-key-1",
   *             "on": true,
   *             "variations": [ "a", "b" ]
   *         },
   *         "flag-key-2": {
   *             "key": "flag-key-2",
   *             "on": true,
   *             "variations": [ "c", "d" ]
   *         }
   *     },
   *     "segments": {
   *         "segment-key-1": {
   *             "key": "segment-key-1",
   *             "includes": [ "user-key-1" ]
   *         }
   *     }
   * }
   * </pre>
   * <p>
   * Data in this format allows the SDK to exactly duplicate all the kinds of flag behavior supported
   * by LaunchDarkly. However, in many cases you will not need this complexity, but will just want to
   * set specific flag keys to specific values. For that, you can use a much simpler format:
   * <pre>
   * {
   *     "flagValues": {
   *         "my-string-flag-key": "value-1",
   *         "my-boolean-flag-key": true,
   *         "my-integer-flag-key": 3
   *     }
   * }
   * </pre>
   * <p>
   * Or, in YAML:
   * <pre>
   * flagValues:
   *   my-string-flag-key: "value-1"
   *   my-boolean-flag-key: true
   *   my-integer-flag-key: 3
   * </pre>
   * <p>
   * It is also possible to specify both {@code flags} and {@code flagValues}, if you want some flags
   * to have simple values and others to have complex behavior. However, it is an error to use the
   * same flag key or segment key more than once, either in a single file or across multiple files.
   * <p>
   * If the data source encounters any error in any file-- malformed content, a missing file, or a
   * duplicate key-- it will not load flags from any of the files.
   * 
   * @return a data source configuration object
