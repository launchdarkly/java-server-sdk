 * {@link com.launchdarkly.sdk.server.LDConfig} (configuration options for the client).
 * <p>
 * Other commonly used types such as {@link com.launchdarkly.sdk.LDContext} are in the {@code com.launchdarkly.sdk}
 * package, since those are not server-side-specific and are shared with the LaunchDarkly Android SDK.
